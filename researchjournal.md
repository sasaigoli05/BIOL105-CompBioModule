# BIOL 295 Journal
## Learning Objectives:
- [ ] **Introduction to Bioinformatics and Computational Biology**: Understand the basics of protein structure and function, and how computational tools can predict and manipulate these structures.
- [ ] **Programming Fundamentals:** Built and utilize basic programming skills in manipulating protein sequences and running computational simulations.
- [ ] **Protein Engineering and Vaccine Development:** Learn how protein engineering can create modified proteins, including potential vaccines.
- [ ] **Hands-On Experience with AlphaFold:** Use AlphaFold to predict protein structures based on different amino acid sequences.
- [ ] **Data Analysis and Interpretation:** Analyze the effects of changes in the protein sequence on its structure and function.
- [ ] **Introduction to AI/ML/NLP in Biology:** Understand how artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing can be applied to biological data, specifically in predicting protein interactions and engineering proteins with desired traits.

## Meeting Notes:
### Meeting 9/9/2024
- Pre/Post Asessment
- Condense to three learning objectives
- What happens if many people use or many proteins used at once
- What is the application part of the activity
- Condensing out all the extra PLDDT visualizations-- maybe just the color chart and the 3D structure
- Figuring out what the preclass activity is: lecture demonstration, pick a peptide from X database/spreadsheet, binidng affinity design a binder
