# BIOL 295 Journal
## Learning Objectives:
- [ ] **Introduction to Protein Engineering and Modeling**: Understand the basics of protein structure and function and learn how protein engineering can modify proteins in specific ways. 
- [ ] **Programming Fundamentals:** Built and utilize basic programming skills in manipulating protein sequences and running computational simulations and machine learning models.
- [ ] **Data Analysis and Interpretation:** Analyze the effects of changes in the protein sequence on its structure and function.

## Meeting Notes:
### Meeting 9/9/2024
- Pre/Post Asessment
- Condense to three learning objectives
- What happens if many people use or many proteins used at once
- What is the application part of the activity
- Condensing out all the extra PLDDT visualizations-- maybe just the color chart and the 3D structure
- Figuring out what the preclass activity is: lecture demonstration, pick a peptide from X database/spreadsheet, binidng affinity design a binder
