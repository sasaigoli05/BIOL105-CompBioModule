# BIOL 295 Journal
## Learning Objectives:
- [ ] **Introduction to Protein Engineering and Modeling**: Explain the fundamentals of protein structure and function, and demonstrate how protein engineering techniques can be used to modify proteins in specific and purposeful ways. 
- [ ] **Programming Fundamentals:** Apply introductory-level programming skills to manipulate protein sequences, run computational simulations, and implement machine learning models for protein analysis.
- [ ] **Data Analysis and Interpretation:** Evaluate the effects of sequence alterations on **_X protein_** structure and function, using case studies and computational models to understand the impact of specific mutations.

## Meeting Notes:
### Meeting 9/9/2024
- Pre/Post Asessment
- Condense to three learning objectives
- What happens if many people use or many proteins used at once
- What is the application part of the activity
- Condensing out all the extra PLDDT visualizations-- maybe just the color chart and the 3D structure
- Figuring out what the preclass activity is: lecture demonstration, pick a peptide from X database/spreadsheet, binidng affinity design a binder

## Notes:
- [Phosphormer ST webtool](https://phosformer.netlify.app/prediction)
- integrate phosphormer ST into collab with AlphaFold2
