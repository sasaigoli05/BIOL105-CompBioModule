# BIOL 295 Journal
## Learning Objectives:
- [ ] **Introduction to Protein Engineering and Modeling**: Explain the fundamentals of protein structure and function, and demonstrate how protein engineering techniques can be used to modify proteins in specific and purposeful ways. 
- [ ] **Programming Fundamentals:** Apply introductory-level programming skills to manipulate protein sequences, run computational simulations, and implement machine learning models for protein analysis.
- [ ] **Data Analysis and Interpretation:** Evaluate the effects of sequence alterations on **_X protein_** structure and function, using case studies and computational models to understand the impact of specific mutations.

## Meeting Notes:
### Meeting 9/9/2024
- Pre/Post Asessment
- Condense to three learning objectives
- What happens if many people use or many proteins used at once
- What is the application part of the activity
- Condensing out all the extra PLDDT visualizations-- maybe just the color chart and the 3D structure
- Figuring out what the preclass activity is: lecture demonstration, pick a peptide from X database/spreadsheet, binidng affinity design a binder

### Meeting 9/16/2024
- Pre/Post Asessment - figure out what questions or type briefly to address 3/4 per LO
- Play with activity get working -- see if can do a selection of types of kinases
- Condensing out all the extra PLDDT visualizations-- maybe just the color chart and the 3D structure
- Outline preclass video lecture
- Find some kinases compatible with phosphormer, do a binder and break it

## Notes:
- [Phosphormer ST webtool](https://phosformer.netlify.app/prediction)
- [CHEM 430 Data Exploration Pre-Survey](https://docs.google.com/document/d/180h7wvOktOuYyfWFEZdq6IiwffVxg1ufk6Ni9Yt-scA/edit?usp=sharing)
- integrate phosphormer ST into collab with AlphaFold2
- Aurora A kinase (AURKA) and its substrate TPX2. Regulating mitotic spindle-- implicated in Cancers. Binding domain of TPX2 by N-terminus (small). AURKA is ~400 residues.
- **Pre-class componen**t: introductory video lecture (short): show the collab fold, introduce LOs and "research question/problem". **Pre-class survey**: assessing prior knowledge/proficiency
- **In-class**: fixing the "broken binder", content based quiz
- **Post-class:** post-class survey
